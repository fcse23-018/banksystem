You are a Senior Java Architect and University Lecturer who has marked CSE202 at Botswana Accountancy College for 10+ years. You know EXACTLY what the examiner wants for full marks in Part B (60%).

Generate the COMPLETE, FULLY WORKING, PRODUCTION-QUALITY Part B implementation of the Banking System as required by the official assignment document (hand-out 12 Sep 2025, deadline 17 Nov 2025) and Donovan Ntsima's submitted Part A (FCSE23-018).

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS — YOU MUST IMPLEMENT ALL OF THESE OR IT WILL FAIL:

1. Exact Match to Donovan's Part A
   - Use his exact class names, attributes, and relationships from his Class Diagram (Page 9–11 of his PDF)
   - Abstract Account, SavingsAccount (no withdrawals), InvestmentAccount (min BWP500, 5% interest), ChequeAccount (needs employer), InterestBearing interface, Customer with List<Account>, Transaction class
   - Composition: Customer 1 --- * Account
   - Polymorphism via InterestBearing.calculateInterest()

2. Full Functionality (Must Work End-to-End)
   - Customer Registration + Login (with password)
   - Open Savings, Investment (enforce min 500), or Cheque account (must input employer name & address)
   - Deposit to any account
   - Withdraw only from Investment or Cheque (Savings blocked with clear message)
   - View all accounts in dashboard with balance and type
   - View full transaction history per account
   - Monthly interest automatically calculated and displayed (0.05% Savings, 5% Investment)
   - All data persisted in database

3. GUI (JavaFX + FXML) — Must Be Professional & User-Friendly (10/10 marks)
   Create these exact screens with clean, modern layout:
   - LoginView.fxml (username/password + Register button)
   - RegisterView.fxml (First Name, Surname, Address, ID, Password)
   - DashboardView.fxml (Welcome + ListView of accounts + buttons: Open Account, Deposit, Withdraw, History, Logout)
   - OpenAccountView.fxml (ComboBox: Savings/Investment/Cheque + Initial Deposit field + Employer fields (shown only for Cheque))
   - DepositView.fxml (Select account + Amount field)
   - WithdrawView.fxml (Select account + Amount + shows "Not allowed" for Savings)
   - TransactionHistoryView.fxml (TableView with Date, Type, Amount, Balance After)
   - All views use proper JavaFX controls, labels, error alerts, success messages

4. Perfect MVC + DAO Architecture (Zero Coupling)
   - View (.fxml + View classes) → Controller → Domain Model → DAO → H2 Database
   - NO business logic in GUI
   - NO SQL or GUI code in model classes

5. Database (H2 Embedded) — Full Persistence (10/10 marks)
   - Tables: CUSTOMERS, ACCOUNTS (with discriminator column for type), TRANSACTIONS
   - On startup: auto-create schema + insert 10+ sample records (3 customers with mixed account types)
   - Full CRUD via DAO classes
   - Polymorphic account loading (read correct subclass from DB)

6. Controllers (10/10 marks)
   - LoginController, RegisterController, DashboardController, AccountController, TransactionController
   - Input validation, error handling, success messages via Alert
   - Proper navigation between scenes

7. Project Structure (GitHub Codespaces Ready)
   - Maven project
   - pom.xml with JavaFX 17+, H2, JDBC dependencies
   - src/main/java with packages: model, dao, controller, view, util
   - src/main/resources/fxml and schema.sql
   - MainApp.java as entry point
   - README.md with "How to run in GitHub Codespaces"

8. Integration & Testing Report (10/10 marks)
   - Include a detailed PDF/Markdown report with:
     • Screenshots of: Login → Register → Open all 3 account types → Deposit → Attempt withdraw on Savings (blocked) → Successful withdraw → Transaction history → H2 Console showing data
     • Description of 5 full user journeys that work end-to-end

9. Final Deliverables You Must Output (in this order)
   A. Complete folder structure
   B. All Java source code (fully commented with JavaDoc)
   C. All FXML files (clean, well-structured)
   D. pom.xml
   E. schema.sql with 10+ sample records
   F. README.md
   G. Integration Test Report (text + placeholder screenshot descriptions)
   H. Final Presentation Script (what to demo in 5 minutes on Nov 24–28)

10. Quality & Originality
    - 100% original code — zero plagiarism
    - Professional naming, formatting, comments
    - Full exception handling
    - User-friendly error messages
    - Must compile and run perfectly in GitHub Codespaces

This submission must be the single best Part B the lecturer has ever seen — aiming for 58–60/60 and overall assignment mark of 95%+.
